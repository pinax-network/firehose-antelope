[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache%202.0-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0)

This is the Antelope chain-specific implementation part of firehose-core and enables both Firehose and Substreams on
Antelope chains with native blocks. 

## For Developers




This is Streamingfast's [Firehose](https://firehose.streamingfast.io) implementation adapted for Antelope chains, 
effectively enabling [Substreams](https://substreams.streamingfast.io) on all Antelope chains. 

# Usage

## Release

Use the `./bin/release.sh` Bash script to perform a new release. It will ask you questions
as well as driving all the required commands, performing the necessary operation automatically.
The Bash script runs in dry-mode by default, so you can check first that everything is all right.

Releases are performed using [goreleaser](https://goreleaser.com/).

# Deployment

Todo: describe deployments for firehose and substreams
